== Theme Notes == 

= Slider =

After the theme is installed, the metabox "Slider Settings" will appear in WordPress admin panel in the post editing section.
In this metabox you will see two input fields: text-field and checkbox. If you mark the checkbox, the featured image of this particular post will appear in the slider.
Every post (or page) has its own metabox, so if you go to another post (or page) and mark the checkbox, there the featured image of that post (or page) will be added to the slider as well, and the slider will have two slides. You can add as many posts (or pages) to the slider as you want.
The slider itself is located on the header and consists of three parts: title (title of post), image (featured image of post), description (short description typed into the text-field in the metabox "Slider Settings").

= Post Thumbnail Functionality =

To post thumbnails, we recommend using the image with the width equal to 1800px.

= Post Formats: Aside, Gallery, Link, Image, Quote, Status, Video, Audio, Chat =

Travel Advisor WordPress theme only supports these post formats. Please style them in a certain way. Other post formats will be displayed as normal posts.

The theme includes standard widgets and the following custom widgets:
- Travel Advisor Recent Posts Widget for displaying post thumbnail, title, and publication date.
- Travel Advisor RSS Widget for displaying post title, quote, and publication date.
